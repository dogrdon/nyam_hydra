They died because they were born too weak to combat the diseases of babyhood.  They were born weak because their mothers did not properly care for themselves during the period of pregnancy; overwork, lack of exercise, in-sufficient or improper nourishment, irregularity in eating and sleeping, worry and nervousness were some of the many causes.<br><br> Every mother desires to have her baby born healthy and strong.  Every baby has right to be so born.  You can do much at this time to insure your baby being born well and strong.  Prepare yourself in advance--be regular in your habits; build yourself up by eating wholesome food; avoid beer, whiskey and drugs; talk to your doctor about yourself, or go to any BABIES' PURE MILK STATION for advice.<br><br> When the time comes for the baby to be born, you must use special care so as not to have your own health or that of your baby impaired.  Remember that one-half of all the blindness in this world is due to improper care of the baby's eyes immediately after birth.<br><br> To avoid having your own health and that of your baby impaired at the time of birth, you will need especial care.  Obtain the best.  It will be worth while.  If you can go to the hospital, do so by all means; there you will receive proper medical and nursing care for yourself and baby.  Select from the list of hospitals given in this circular, the one to which you desire to apply for admission, and make arrangements at least two weeks in advance of the date of confinement. If you cannot leave<br><br> [page break]<br> your home because of other children, go to a ""Blue Front"" BABIES' PURE MILK AND HEALTH STATION for advice; there the nurse will be glad to tell you of hospitals and settlements which will provide medical treatment and nurse services in your own home.  Many agencies will furnish female physicians in desired.  These services can be obtained at a small charge, or free if you cannot afford to pay.<br> Do not forget you owe it to your unborn babe to bring it into the world well and strong. This you can do only if you are willing to learn how.<br><br> [a list of hospitals follows]",,

V. McCollum, of Johns Hopkins Uni-<br>versity, says discoveries of the past three years show that <br> there are existing in milk and some other foods two un-<br>known substances which stimulate growth. One of these <br> is found in the fat and the other is found in the water or <br> solution. Their chemical charcter is unknown and they<br> have never been separated from the food materials with <br> which they are associated. Professor McCollum has <br> pointed out that the seeds of plants are good food so far<br> as they go, but they are deficient in these growth-<br>promoting substances, which are found chiefly in the <br>leaves of  all trees and plants. They are found in such<br> leaves as cabbage, lettuce,spinach and cauliflower and <br> above all in milk.Concerning milk and milk products, <br> he says it is not generally appreciated that these articles<br> have a dietary value greater than can be expressed <br> by their protein and energy contents. In experiments <br> on rats, Professors Osborne, Mendel and McCollum have <br> shown that the feeding of butter fat and of milk promotes <br>growth in a remarkable way for the reason that the vita-<br> mines or growth-promoting substances are present in milk <br> in an abundance and in a form which is readily available, <br> as in non other of our common foods.",Document not scanned in entirety due to fragility.,

Night after night I hear him cry. One day I asked her why he crys so.<br>  She said she did not know. I asked what she feeds him and she said on <br>  groceries milk. I soon know why the baby crys so, it had stomach trouble. I<br>   asked why she doesn't keep the milk on ice and she says she cannot afford it. So <br>  I gave her the address to the milk depot. I told her to tell the person in charge <br>  that she cannot afford to buy ice and they will try to help her.<br>  The day after she went to store and the doctor told her the baby had <br>  stomach trouble. He gave the baby the right milk and a ticket for ice. Since that <br>  very day the baby drinks the milk, he sleeps during the night as if there were no <br>  baby. She thanked me very much and said I have saved a child from suffering <br>  pain and a mother from becoming ill, because when people do not sleep at night <br>  they usually become sick<br><br>   What I Have Done for the Mother's League <br>  One day as I was walking in the street I saw a baby in a carriage fast asleep <br>  with a nipple and an empty bottle in its mouth. So I saw the mother from the <br>  child and I told her nipples is a real death for a child. When the baby is having<br>   its sleep, the nipple should be in a glass of borax water ready for its meal. The <br>  mother from that child thanked me very much <br><br>  Another Testimony <br>  One day I walked in the street and I saw a woman giving a baby a loly-pop<br>   which had been sucked some time by her elder son. I went over and told her that<br>   loly-pops or any such food was the same as giving the child some poison. She <br>  asked me how I know and I told her I had learned it at the Little Mother's <br>  League. She took the subject under consideration and threw the loly-pop <br>  away.<br><br>  How I Helped the Mother's League<br>   My little sister does not feel well I said to mother: ""Mama, baby has diaria <br>  or loose bowels. Stop all milk, solid food, give her a dose of castor oil,<br>  and then take her to the doctor. My mother tried castor oil, by nothing helped.<br>  She went to the doctor, I went along to see what he would say, and what do you<br>   think he said, exactly what I did and added something new to it.<br><br>  How I Was a 'Little Mother' <br>  One day when I was on the pier with my little brother, a man who took care <br>  of a baby gave it a bottle of coffee. I saw the bottle was dirty and told him the<br>   baby would get sick. He said to me "" Mind your business."" I said I belong to <br>  the Little Mothers' League and know how to take care of babies. The next time <br>  I saw the baby sleeping with a loly-pop in his mouth, the flies were flying on it,<br>  but my little brother was covered with a veil and I fanned him. The next week I<br>   saw the baby and he looked sick. I told the father to go to the doctor. Now he <br>  took my advice and when he came back he said the baby had summer complaint,<br>  but in three weeks the baby was well again. I think the father will never again <br>  give the baby those things.<br><br>  The Care of a Baby for One Day <br>  It is half past six and my little brown eyed Dorothy has awaked, and the <br>  first thing I must do is to give her a nice cool bath, and my! how little Dorothy <br>  can kick, Now I will put on her soft clean clothes. My little Dorothy then must <br>  be fed on barley and milk. I will take her to the recreation pier, how the baby is <br>  enjoying it! She seems to be hungry, come we will go home, eat and come back <br>  again. When I got home I undressed baby and gave her another bath the I fed <br>  her again and she went asleep. When she awoke up I took her for a walk   through the park. It was getting toward evening and the sun was going down <br>  so I walked home with baby slowly <br><br>",,

The mother, whom we wish the reader to picture as hitherto  a monument of obstinacy, experiences and instant change of heart, seizes the baby, and rushes to the street. <br><br>  ""Tell me,"" she cries, ""the nearest way to the house with the blue front.""<br><br>  The chances are 100 to 1 that somebody can give her the information instantly, and she rushes where she knows help in the form of a trained nurse awaits her, and baby is saved, with what we may describe as the   cheers of the populace. <br><br>  This is not primarily the function of the milk station, but, then, on the  other hand selling milk is also only a part of the work of such a place. The blue front milk stations are meant, indeed, to furnish good, pure milk that can safely be drunk by the feeblest baby stomach, but it is the education of the mothers who come to the place. <br><br>  The battle for the lives of children in New York is about to be   fought more fiercely than ever. Already this city stands far ahead of   any other on the continent in the care it gives its little children, and this year the New York Milk Committee, of 105 East Twenty-second Street, has   undertaken to give a demonstration to the city of the reduction that is possi-  ble through maintaining a large number of stations where good milk and   better advice are always ready for anyone who comes to seek. <br><br>  It is submitted that it costs $50 to bury a baby. It has been demon-  strated that babies can be saved at a cost of $50 a year for each baby. The New York Milk Committee say - really it sounds very sensible: ""All   things considered, we might just as wll save babies as bury them,   seeing that it does not cost any more.""<br><br>  The odd thing is that it has taken us some time to get the point   of this. It does seem pretty clear when it is pointed out, but we   have been floundering after it for a long time.   <br><br>Even last Summer, when New York had the lowest death rate among   the large cities fo the country, over 1,000 babies were buried in two weeks.    The number of babies born during the year equaled the population of New   Haven, and one-eighth of them died in the course of the twelve months.   And yet other cities made a far worse showing than New York. <br><br>  The Department of Health did know how to save many of the babies.   It knew perfectly well, but that costs money, and the average taxpayer has   not yet grasped the fact that has come home to many individuals, that $50   for saving a baby is a better way to spend money than giving $50   for burying a baby. But this year as many of these deaths are   going to be prevented as possible, and the New York Milk Com-   mittee is to make what is intended to be a striking demonstration   of what can be obtained by a great big campaign against the deaths   that hide everywhere for the little mites. <br><br>  The experiment is being made in close co-operation with the   Board of Health.   The value of the milk stations, says an expert on the question,  lies about 25 per cent. in the milk and 75 per cent. in the advice   given. It used to be the custom to prepare the milk for babies   according to a set formula, such and such for children under three   months old, and such and such for children a year old, etc. this   worked well enough for the ""average"" child, but unfortunately the   majority of children are not ""average"" at all. The New York Milk   Committee is taking a new system altogether.",,

New York City.,inside face 2 of mk1e0016, mk1e0016.jpg,Halftone photomechanical prints,Bernadette CARDONA,,"It is a very simple matter to teach a woman to prepare milk for her own chid. At every milk station there will be a nurse to do this. She will show any amount of patience that may be necessary in wrestling with idiosyn- crasies of each individual family, and not one mother will come away from the milk station without having an idea as clear as possible of the way in which the baby should be fed and cared for.<br> <br> Under the old system, when the milk was all prepared in little bottles, there were a dozen details that the mother neglected at home. The bottle was put down in a dirty place, the nipple was taken off, and cockroaches and similar lively insects would creep in. The mother did nothing about it,  because she had not been made to understand how important to health cleanliness was.  <br> <br>The Milk Committee makes her understand this, and sees that the good done at the station is not undone by ignorant careless-  ness. The nurses will work in the homes, too, so far as possible, by fol-lowing up special cases. <br><br> [illustration with title caption: INSTRUCTION IN THE HOME ] <br><br> There are doctors who will visit the station at stated times and who will  prescribe for every baby that comes. Not only do they prescribe the diet necessary for the child, but they are able to set the mother on the right  track if the child has some disease that requires special attention from a clinic. Not every baby, who comes to the station miserably undersized and puny, is suffering from malnutrition. When, however, it is malnutrition from which they suffer, it is singular to see the lines in their charts.  <br><br>Every baby that comes has a chart. Along the middle runs a line in- dicating the normal weight for a baby under a year. It goes in a long, slanting upward line. When the babies come in, little dots are put to register their relation to the line, and in practically every case these dots are a pitifully long way below the normal. A baby that should weigh fifteen pounds will weigh but eight or ten; then it gets its clutch upon the milk  bottle from the station, and presto! the line goes up so suddenly towards  the normal that it is almost perpendicular. <br><br> It is startling to see the instant improvement that follows the visits to the milk station. What ails the child usually is nothing in the world but starvation. It is useful thought to take home and ponder evenings when there is nothing else to do that hundreds of babies starve to death every year in New York City.",,

I went home with her and found the sick woman on a cot in the corner of a dark, ill ven-tilated room, bare of all furniture. She was weak, discouraged, and unwilling to talk -- a picture of a nervous break-down. The baby was crying and moaning. The husband had been out of work for a long time and the family income was $5 weekly which the oldest girl earned. One child had already died of intestinal trouble and this baby was going fast.<br> It was so easy to care for the mother, to modify the milk and get the baby started right, but it meant so much for that family. Later the mother came to our classes. Her complete ignor- ance about herself and her baby was startling, but we taught her easily as she was so eager to learn. I wish you could see the baby now. It weighs 14 pounds at 5 months, and is a dear.  You would hardly know the mother; she is not a healthy woman yet but as all worry about her child has been removed she has confidence and strength again to live. Her face always wears a happy smile when she comes to see us.",,

This Association represents 150 agencies and has for its object the stadardization of methods and the proper distribution of work so as to eliminate duplication and over-lapping; to serve as a clearing house for information relating to the work of reducing infant mortality.   <br><br>   Provided the Babies' Welfare Association with an Executive Secretary and borne the expense of preparing and printing educational literature for distribution among tenement housing mothers.  Already 300,000 peiceds of literature hve been distributed in the English, Italian and Yiddish languages.  Although our vigorous campaign last year brought about the lowest baby death rate in the history of New York City there is every indication that the good record of last year will be not only maintained but exceeded.   <br><br>   Carried on throught its Committee on Womens' Organizations an active campaign among women's clubs, civic organizations and churches to demand a strict enforcement by the Health Department of the present rules and regulations relating to the production and sale of milk.   <br><br>   Conducted an exhaustive investigation as to the quality of milk served to patrongs of hotels, restaurants, lunch rooms and soda fountains in the business and shopping sections of Manhattan and Brooklyn.  The results of this investigation have been forwarded to the Board of Health and follow-up work already begun to insure a better and more wholesome milk supply to patrons of these places.   <br><br>   Appointed a Special Committe to study the present methods employed by the State to stamp out tuberculosis among cattle, and to formulate plans to obtain a more adequate State cotnrol of this disease.   <br><br>   Prepared comprehensive educational exhibits for the International Congress of Hygiene and Demography and for the New York State Fair.   <br><br>   Completed the first six months of its investigation of deaths for congenital diseases and its experiment to determine the balue of educating expectant mothers as a means of reducing infant mortality from these diseases.  822 mothers have already been educated in the prenatal care of their babies and themselves by a competent staff of nurses and doctors.  The results already obtained indicate that the death rate among babies from congenital disease can be reduced fully 50% and a higher vitality assured to babies if the tenement mothers are given proper instruction in mothercraft.",,

June 1819] Arrangements for an extensive and permanent establishement under the above title having been made by the subscriber, on the plan of the best establishments ofa similar nature in Great Britain, he takes this method of informing his friends and fellow-citizens that he will be ready to supply them with milk on the first of June next, and at all times after that date, on receiving ten days previous notice.<br> In the mean while he begs leave respectfully to solicit their encouragement of his enterprise on the following conditions and assurances, viz.:<br> 1. That he will serve them with milk delivered in its original purity, uncorrupted by any mixture or adulteration whatsoever.<br> 2. That he will therefore carefully avoid the excessive use too frequently made of the slops of distilleries in feeding the cows, which is well known to impoverish the milk, if not to infect it with unwholesome qualities.<br> 3. That he will spare no pains to preserve and deliver the mik clean; bestowing his personal and careful attention to give it this most important and unusual recommendation.<br> 4. That in distributing the milk by his carriers he will employ such precautions as shall preclude the possibility, either from carelessness or design, of the fraud of deficient measure; which in the usual mode of distribution is so easily and securely practised on the negligence of servants.<br> 5. That the milk shall be served to his customers with the strictest attention to punctuality; at any hour of the day, and in any quantity, that may be desired; -- the situation of his establishment, only two miles from the City Hall, on the Eighth Avenue, affording peculiar facilities for their accommodation in this respect.<br> 6. That his milk, thus pure, clean, correctly measured, and punctually served, shall always be delivered to his customers at the lowest market price.<br> Finally; that having provided buildings for his stables of the most commodious and substantial construction, and large enough to admit of between two and three hundred separate stalls, he will prosecute his design with assiduous fidelity to these conditions and assurances, yielding to no obstables or dificulties it may encounter, so long as the patronage of his friends and the public may encourage his perseverance.  And on these grounds, connected with the obvious public utility of an establishment of this nature, so managed as to deserve and justify the public confidence, he again respectfully solicits their encouragement of his enterprise in the outset.<br> THOMAS WARNER.<br> N.B. Persons wishing to be supplied with milk on the above conditions, are invited to leave their applications, addressed to the subscriber, at the Post-office, specifying where they live, and when, and with what quantity of milk, they would be served.  And if any should wish for a further and more minute explanation of the plan of the proposed establishement, and of the means of carrying it into effect, and will signify that wish as here directed, it shall be promptly attended to.",(resized PShop),
