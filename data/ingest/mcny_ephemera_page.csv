They died because they were born too weak to combat the diseases of babyhood.  They were born weak because their mothers did not properly care for themselves during the period of pregnancy; overwork, lack of exercise, in-sufficient or improper nourishment, irregularity in eating and sleeping, worry and nervousness were some of the many causes.<br><br> Every mother desires to have her baby born healthy and strong.  Every baby has right to be so born.  You can do much at this time to insure your baby being born well and strong.  Prepare yourself in advance--be regular in your habits; build yourself up by eating wholesome food; avoid beer, whiskey and drugs; talk to your doctor about yourself, or go to any BABIES' PURE MILK STATION for advice.<br><br> When the time comes for the baby to be born, you must use special care so as not to have your own health or that of your baby impaired.  Remember that one-half of all the blindness in this world is due to improper care of the baby's eyes immediately after birth.<br><br> To avoid having your own health and that of your baby impaired at the time of birth, you will need especial care.  Obtain the best.  It will be worth while.  If you can go to the hospital, do so by all means; there you will receive proper medical and nursing care for yourself and baby.  Select from the list of hospitals given in this circular, the one to which you desire to apply for admission, and make arrangements at least two weeks in advance of the date of confinement. If you cannot leave<br><br> [page break]<br> your home because of other children, go to a ""Blue Front"" BABIES' PURE MILK AND HEALTH STATION for advice; there the nurse will be glad to tell you of hospitals and settlements which will provide medical treatment and nurse services in your own home.  Many agencies will furnish female physicians in desired.  These services can be obtained at a small charge, or free if you cannot afford to pay.<br> Do not forget you owe it to your unborn babe to bring it into the world well and strong.

V. McCollum, of Johns Hopkins Uni-<br>versity, says discoveries of the past three years show that <br> there are existing in milk and some other foods two un-<br>known substances which stimulate growth. One of these <br> is found in the fat and the other is found in the water or <br> solution. Their chemical charcter is unknown and they<br> have never been separated from the food materials with <br> which they are associated. Professor McCollum has <br> pointed out that the seeds of plants are good food so far<br> as they go, but they are deficient in these growth-<br>promoting substances, which are found chiefly in the <br>leaves of  all trees and plants. They are found in such<br> leaves as cabbage, lettuce,spinach and cauliflower and <br> above all in milk.Concerning milk and milk products, <br> he says it is not generally appreciated that these articles<br> have a dietary value greater than can be expressed <br> by their protein and energy contents. In experiments <br> on rats, Professors Osborne, Mendel and McCollum have <br> shown that the feeding of butter fat and of milk promotes <br>growth in a remarkable way for the reason that the vita-<br> mines or growth-promoting substances are present in milk <br> in an abundance and in a form which is readily available, <br> as in non other of our common foods.",Document not scanned in entirety due to fragility.,55.jpg55,57,1,,Image 1 of 2,56.jpg56,57,1,,Image 2 of 2.

Night after night I hear him cry. One day I asked her why he crys so.<br>  She said she did not know. I asked what she feeds him and she said on <br>  groceries milk. I soon know why the baby crys so, it had stomach trouble. I<br>   asked why she doesn't keep the milk on ice and she says she cannot afford it. So <br>  I gave her the address to the milk depot. I told her to tell the person in charge <br>  that she cannot afford to buy ice and they will try to help her.<br>  The day after she went to store and the doctor told her the baby had <br>  stomach trouble. He gave the baby the right milk and a ticket for ice. Since that <br>  very day the baby drinks the milk, he sleeps during the night as if there were no <br>  baby.

So I saw the mother from the <br>  child and I told her nipples is a real death for a child. When the baby is having<br>   its sleep, the nipple should be in a glass of borax water ready for its meal. The <br>  mother from that child thanked me very much <br><br>  Another Testimony <br>  One day I walked in the street and I saw a woman giving a baby a loly-pop<br>   which had been sucked some time by her elder son.

I saw the bottle was dirty and told him the<br>   baby would get sick. He said to me "" Mind your business."" I said I belong to <br>  the Little Mothers' League and know how to take care of babies. The next time <br>  I saw the baby sleeping with a loly-pop in his mouth, the flies were flying on it,<br>  but my little brother was covered with a veil and I fanned him. The next week I<br>   saw the baby and he looked sick. I told the father to go to the doctor. Now he <br>  took my advice and when he came back he said the baby had summer complaint,<br>  but in three weeks the baby was well again.

She seems to be hungry, come we will go home, eat and come back <br>  again. When I got home I undressed baby and gave her another bath the I fed <br>  her again and she went asleep.

The blue   was the blue of an afternoon sky. Nobody could pass such a place without stopping to look. It gripped you by the arm and held you while you pon-dered its purpose. <br><br>  This is the way it is expected to work. Take a mother who has stren-  ously refused to rear her offspring along scientific lines. She gives it tea, coffee, strawberry shortcake and pickles. One day alarming symptoms   develop. The mother, whom we wish the reader to picture as hitherto  a monument of obstinacy, experiences and instant change of heart, seizes the baby, and rushes to the street. <br><br>  ""Tell me,"" she cries, ""the nearest way to the house with the blue front.""<br><br>  The chances are 100 to 1 that somebody can give her the information instantly, and she rushes where she knows help in the form of a trained nurse awaits her, and baby is saved, with what we may describe as the   cheers of the populace. <br><br>  This is not primarily the function of the milk station, but, then, on the  other hand selling milk is also only a part of the work of such a place. The blue front milk stations are meant, indeed, to furnish good, pure milk that can safely be drunk by the feeblest baby stomach, but it is the education of the mothers who come to the place. <br><br>  The battle for the lives of children in New York is about to be   fought more fiercely than ever. Already this city stands far ahead of   any other on the continent in the care it gives its little children, and this year the New York Milk Committee, of 105 East Twenty-second Street, has   undertaken to give a demonstration to the city of the reduction that is possi-  ble through maintaining a large number of stations where good milk and   better advice are always ready for anyone who comes to seek. <br><br>  It is submitted that it costs $50 to bury a baby. It has been demon-  strated that babies can be saved at a cost of $50 a year for each baby. The New York Milk Committee say - really it sounds very sensible: ""All   things considered, we might just as wll save babies as bury them,   seeing that it does not cost any more.""<br><br>  The odd thing is that it has taken us some time to get the point   of this. It does seem pretty clear when it is pointed out, but we   have been floundering after it for a long time.   <br><br>Even last Summer, when New York had the lowest death rate among   the large cities fo the country, over 1,000 babies were buried in two weeks.    The number of babies born during the year equaled the population of New   Haven, and one-eighth of them died in the course of the twelve months.   And yet other cities made a far worse showing than New York. <br><br>  The Department of Health did know how to save many of the babies.   It knew perfectly well, but that costs money, and the average taxpayer has   not yet grasped the fact that has come home to many individuals, that $50   for saving a baby is a better way to spend money than giving $50   for burying a baby. But this year as many of these deaths are   going to be prevented as possible, and the New York Milk Com-   mittee is to make what is intended to be a striking demonstration   of what can be obtained by a great big campaign against the deaths   that hide everywhere for the little mites. <br><br>  The experiment is being made in close co-operation with the   Board of Health.   The value of the milk stations, says an expert on the question,  lies about 25 per cent. in the milk and 75 per cent. in the advice   given. It used to be the custom to prepare the milk for babies   according to a set formula, such and such for children under three   months old, and such and such for children a year old, etc. this   worked well enough for the ""average"" child, but unfortunately the   majority of children are not ""average"" at all. The New York Milk   Committee is taking a new system altogether.",,92.jpg92,94,1,"It is a very simple matter to teach a woman to prepare milk for her own chid. At every milk station there will be a nurse to do this. She will show any amount of patience that may be necessary in wrestling with idiosyn- crasies of each individual family, and not one mother will come away from the milk station without having an idea as clear as possible of the way in which the baby should be fed and cared for.<br> <br> Under the old system, when the milk was all prepared in little bottles, there were a dozen details that the mother neglected at home. The bottle was put down in a dirty place, the nipple was taken off, and cockroaches and similar lively insects would creep in. The mother did nothing about it,  because she had not been made to understand how important to health cleanliness was.  <br> <br>The Milk Committee makes her understand this, and sees that the good done at the station is not undone by ignorant careless-  ness. The nurses will work in the homes, too, so far as possible, by fol-lowing up special cases. <br><br> [illustration with title caption: INSTRUCTION IN THE HOME ] <br><br> There are doctors who will visit the station at stated times and who will  prescribe for every baby that comes. Not only do they prescribe the diet necessary for the child, but they are able to set the mother on the right  track if the child has some disease that requires special attention from a clinic. Not every baby, who comes to the station miserably undersized and puny, is suffering from malnutrition. When, however, it is malnutrition from which they suffer, it is singular to see the lines in their charts.  <br><br>Every baby that comes has a chart. Along the middle runs a line in- dicating the normal weight for a baby under a year. It goes in a long, slanting upward line. When the babies come in, little dots are put to register their relation to the line, and in practically every case these dots are a pitifully long way below the normal. A baby that should weigh fifteen pounds will weigh but eight or ten; then it gets its clutch upon the milk  bottle from the station, and presto! the line goes up so suddenly towards  the normal that it is almost perpendicular. <br><br> It is startling to see the instant improvement that follows the visits to the milk station. What ails the child usually is nothing in the world but starvation.

Pure Milk was distributed on ice and the mothers taught how to care for it. Doctors at weekly classes taught the mothers how to feed their babies. Trained nurses visited their homes and taught them how to be clean and healthy. The babies of these mothers gained steadily in spite of the heat, poverty and congestion.

We learned about her through a liitle girl who came to us and said her mother was sick and desired help. I went home with her and found the sick woman on a cot in the corner of a dark, ill ven-tilated room, bare of all furniture. She was weak, discouraged, and unwilling to talk -- a picture of a nervous break-down. The baby was crying and moaning. The husband had been out of work for a long time and the family income was $5 weekly which the oldest girl earned. One child had already died of intestinal trouble and this baby was going fast.<br> It was so easy to care for the mother, to modify the milk and get the baby started right, but it meant so much for that family. Later the mother came to our classes. Her complete ignor- ance about herself and her baby was startling, but we taught her easily as she was so eager to learn. I wish you could see the baby now. It weighs 14 pounds at 5 months, and is a dear.  You would hardly know the mother; she is not a healthy woman yet but as all worry about her child has been removed she has confidence and strength again to live.
